# Introduction

## What is Blacktail?

Blacktail is an innovative blockchain-based platform that facilitates the supply of computational resources, training, development, decentralisation, community dissemination and commercialization of AI models. By integrating blockchain technology with decentralized principles, Blacktail enables users to contribute their GPU power, access advanced AI tools, and participate in a dynamic marketplace where AI models can be developed and sold. This approach democratizes access to AI technologies, fostering a more inclusive and equitable AI development ecosystem.

### Vision <a href="#id-30j0zll" id="id-30j0zll"></a>

Blacktail's vision is to establish a comprehensive ecosystem that promotes the development of decentralized AI. This ecosystem is designed to accelerate the progress of AI technology while mitigating the risks associated with centralization. Traditional centralized AI systems are prone to biases and are susceptible to being leveraged as mechanisms of control by corporations and governments. By decentralizing the AI development process, Blacktail aims to ensure that AI remains an unbiased and universally beneficial tool, free from undue influence and control.

### Key Components and Benefits <a href="#id-1fob9te" id="id-1fob9te"></a>

GenAI Hub Access: Blacktail offers a platform that consolidates the most popular Generation AI models, allowing users to access all models under one account or subscription. It features a user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to navigate and utilize various AI models. This seamless integration simplifies the use of advanced AI tools, catering to both beginners and professionals.

DMarket Community AI Marketplace: The marketplace component of Blacktail allows developers to upload, share, and monetize their AI models. This feature not only provides a revenue stream for developers but also encourages the sharing of knowledge and collaboration within the AI community, driving further innovation and development.

Decentralized GPU dPIN Community: Blacktail harnesses the collective computational power of its community members, who contribute their GPU resources.
