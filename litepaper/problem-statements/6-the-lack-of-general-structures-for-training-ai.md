# 6: The Lack of General Structures for Training AI

## Problem Statement 6: The Lack of General Structures for Training AI

&#x20;

The advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) relies heavily on the development and modification of AI models tailored to specific needs. Open source general frameworks for AI models play a crucial role in this process by providing foundational tools and libraries that developers can adapt. However, the current scarcity of such open source frameworks presents significant challenges for small companies and individual developers. This paper examines the implications of this deficiency, focusing on its impact on innovation, accessibility, and the democratization of AI development.

Open source frameworks have been pivotal in the proliferation of software development by providing accessible and modifiable resources that foster innovation and collaboration. In the realm of AI, these frameworks are essential for enabling developers to build, experiment with, and refine AI models without the prohibitive costs associated with proprietary solutions. This paper explores the challenges posed by the lack of open source general frameworks for AI models and the consequent barriers faced by small companies and individual developers.

**Importance of Open Source General Frameworks in AI**

#### Problem Statement: Lack of Open Source Basic AI Framework Models <a href="#de4v4o5cyjxl" id="de4v4o5cyjxl"></a>

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) heavily relies on the availability of robust and accessible frameworks that facilitate the creation and training of various AI models. However, the current landscape is marked by a significant deficiency in open source basic AI framework models, which poses substantial challenges for smaller companies and individual developers.

**Challenges Faced by Developers**

1. High Development Costs and Time: Developing AI models from scratch is both time-consuming and costly. For small companies and individual developers, the financial and temporal investment required to build and train AI models can be prohibitive. This barrier limits the ability to innovate and compete with larger organizations that have greater resources.\
   \

2. Limited Access to Advanced AI Technologies: The absence of open source frameworks restricts access to advanced AI technologies. Developers who lack the resources to purchase expensive proprietary models or who are unable to access cutting-edge research are at a distinct disadvantage. This limitation hampers the democratization of AI and perpetuates inequalities within the tech industry.\
   \

3. Reinventing the Wheel: Without access to pre-built frameworks, developers often need to reinvent the wheel, duplicating efforts that have already been made elsewhere. This redundancy leads to inefficiencies and slows the overall progress of AI development. Open source frameworks would allow developers to build upon existing work, fostering innovation and accelerating advancements in the field.\
   \

4. Lack of Customizable and Collaborative Tools: Proprietary AI models are often not customizable or conducive to collaboration. Open source frameworks, on the other hand, provide the flexibility needed for developers to tailor models to their specific needs and collaborate with others in the community. The lack of such tools stifles creativity and collaborative problem-solving.
