# 2: Market Community AI Platform

## Proposed Solution 2: DMarket Community AI Platform <a href="#nmf14n" id="nmf14n"></a>

BlackTail's AI DMarket offers a platform where companies and individual developers can upload their AI models, referred to as ‘Pods’. Once these Pods are voted on and approved by the community, they become immediately available to the BlackTail user base and can start earning in cryptocurrency. The platform enables users to rank and review these models, with the best and most popular models gaining higher visibility. This approach aims to address several critical issues in the AI ecosystem, including accessibility, quality assurance, and incentivization for developers.

BlackTail's AI DMarket platform addresses critical issues in the AI ecosystem by promoting decentralization, enhancing transparency, reducing barriers to entry, and fostering innovation and competition. By enabling smaller companies and individual developers to participate in AI development and receive cryptocurrency payments, the platform democratizes access to AI technologies and mitigates the centralization tendencies that currently hinder the field.
