# 4: BlackTail's dPIN GPU System

## Proposed Solution 4: BlackTail's dPIN GPU System <a href="#kgcv8k" id="kgcv8k"></a>

BlackTail's dPIN (Decentralized Processing and Infrastructure Network) GPU system will enable users worldwide to supply their GPU power to community AI developers and projects for training AI models. Participants contributing their GPU power will be compensated in BlackTail tokens, creating an incentivized ecosystem for resource sharing. In addition, BlackTail is building a GPU factory with access to reduced electricity fees in southern Europe to supplement this computational power and reduce charges for developers.&#x20;
