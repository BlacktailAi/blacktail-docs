# 1: GenAI hub

## Proposed Solution 1: GenAI Hub <a href="#id-1jlao46" id="id-1jlao46"></a>

BlackTail's GenAI Hub provides users with access to a diverse range of AI models across various sectors, including conversational assistants, music generation, image generation and editing, video generation, and code generation. This unified platform addresses issues such as fragmentation, accessibility, financial burden, user experience, innovation, and security.

Key components of the platform include:

●         Pods: Individual models with their own user interfaces.

●         Rooms: Dedicated sections for handling LLM models.

●         Suites: Models capable of performing multiple functions, such as custom models or GPT-4o.

BlackTail will eventually offer a user interface that allows users to easily add various generative AI models onto a canvas and interconnect them, enabling the creation of complex, no-code workflows.

Fragmentation and Accessibility

Current AI platforms often require users to subscribe to multiple services to access different AI tools, each with its own interface, subscription plan, and usage policies. This fragmentation creates significant barriers for users.
